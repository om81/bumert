## Overview

Bumert is a fluent assertion library designed specifically for Go. It allows developers to write clear and concise assertions in their tests. What sets Bumert apart is its ability to compile to no-ops in production builds, ensuring zero overhead when you need performance. You can enable this feature using the `debug` build tag.

## Key Features

- **Fluent API**: Write assertions in a clear, readable manner.
- **Zero Overhead**: Compiles to no-ops in production.
- **Conditional Compilation**: Use the `debug` build tag to include assertions in your testing environment without affecting production performance.
- **Developer Tools**: Streamline your testing process and improve code quality with ease.

## Installation

To get started with Bumert, you can install it using `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/om81/bumert
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use Bumert in your Go tests:

```go
package main

import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/om81/bumert"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
    result := 2 + 2
    bumert.Assert(t, result).Equals(4)
}
```

### Enabling Assertions

To include assertions in your development environment, use the `debug` build tag when building or testing:

```bash
go test -tags debug
```

Bumert is a community-driven project. If you're interested in improving Bumert, we encourage you to participate in discussions, report bugs, and suggest new features. Your feedback is invaluable.

## FAQs

### Why use Bumert over other assertion libraries?

Bumert provides a fluent API that enhances readability and clarity. The zero overhead feature ensures that your production code remains performant without compromising on the quality of your tests.

### Can I use Bumert in existing projects?

Absolutely! Bumert integrates seamlessly into any Go project. Just install it using `go get` and start using its assertions in your tests.

### What happens if I forget to use the `debug` tag?

If you don‚Äôt use the `debug` tag, the assertions will not compile, resulting in no additional runtime overhead in your production builds.

### Is Bumert actively maintained?

Yes, we strive to keep Bumert updated with the latest best practices and Go features. Regular updates and community contributions help maintain its relevance.

## Example Assertions

Here are some examples of assertions you can make using Bumert:

```go
// Assert that a number is equal to another number
bumert.Assert(t, 1).Equals(1)

// Assert that a string contains another string
bumert.Assert(t, "hello world").Contains("world")

// Assert that an error is nil
err := someFunction()
bumert.Assert(t, err).IsNil()
```

## Conclusion

Bumert is designed to make your testing experience in Go easier and more efficient. With its fluent API and zero overhead, you can write clear assertions without worrying about performance in production. Join the community today, and make your tests better with Bumert!
